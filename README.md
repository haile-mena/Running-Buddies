This project is a multi page website that displays a potential social media site for runners to find, chat, and meetup with. The site can be view differently based on whether the viewer was on desktop or mobile. This challenege was a fun way to develop my HTML and CS skills while coming up with a unique website concept. I've learned a lot about different CSS concept, importing media, and creating a responsive webpage using PHP.

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

The site contains a description and explanation of the goals and intentions of RunBud which is to create a community of runners and create friendships based of their similarities. The site features and About Page and FAQ, to describe and answer possible questions about the site. Since this was a mock concept, the website only contains place holder text and images. The site also features a sign in and sign up page for any current/potential users to join. The sign in page logs the user in while the sign up page asks the user to provide email, password, and to answer a simple questionnaire to determine similarity with other users.
